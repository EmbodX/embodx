# Dimensify

Dimensify is a Rust-based library for visualising and simulating robot motion. It provides tools for modeling, simulating, and visualising robotic systems, including kinematics, motion planning, and interactions in a 3D environment.


## Features

- 3D Visualisation: Render robots and their environments in real-time using modern graphics libraries.
- Physics Simulation: Simulate realistic robot movements with collision detection and dynamics.
- Efficient and Modular: Built in Rust for performance and flexibility, allowing easy extensions for specific robotic applications.
- ROS Integration: Potential integration with ROS for hardware-in-the-loop testing.
